[{"question": "What is the fundamental difference between a linear and a non-linear data structure, and provide one example for each type mentioned in the study material?", "answer": "A linear data structure arranges data elements sequentially, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, allowing all elements to be traversed in a single run. An example is an array. A non-linear data structure does not place data elements sequentially, meaning all elements cannot be traversed in a single run. An example is a tree."}, {"question": "Compare static and dynamic data structures based on their memory size, element access, and memory efficiency, providing an example for each type.", "answer": "Static data structures have a fixed memory size, making element access easier. An example is an array. Dynamic data structures do not have a fixed size; their size can be randomly updated during runtime, which is considered efficient concerning memory (space) complexity. Examples include queues and stacks."}, {"question": "Describe the core principle that governs operations in a Stack data structure. Name the specific operations for adding and removing data, and state which end of the stack these operations occur from.", "answer": "A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The operation for adding data is called \"push,\" and the operation for retrieving data is called \"pop.\" Both push and pop operations are performed from only one end of the stack."}, {"question": "Arrays are widely used in real-life applications. List three specific real-life applications of arrays as mentioned in the study material, and briefly explain why an array's characteristic makes it suitable for one of them.", "answer": "Three real-life applications of arrays are: storing data for mathematical computations, image processing, and record management."}, {"question": "Explain the primary distinction between Time Complexity and Space Complexity of an algorithm. Additionally, identify one factor that Time Complexity *does not* measure, as stated in the material.", "answer": "Time Complexity describes the time required to execute an algorithm, based on the length of the input, and evaluates its performance. Space Complexity represents the amount of memory space a program uses to execute, including auxiliary and input space. Time complexity does not measure the actual execution time because factors such as programming language, operating system, and processing power are also considered."}]
