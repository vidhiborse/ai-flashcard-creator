[{"question": "Which of the following data structures is classified as non-linear because its elements are not placed sequentially and cannot be traversed entirely in a single run?", "options": {"A": "Queue", "B": "Array", "C": "Stack", "D": "Tree"}, "correct": "D"}, {"question": "A developer needs a data structure that allows for easy access to elements and has a fixed memory size defined at the time of creation. Which type of data structure fits these requirements?", "options": {"A": "Dynamic data structure", "B": "Non-linear data structure", "C": "Static data structure", "D": "Linked data structure"}, "correct": "C"}, {"question": "What is a fundamental characteristic of an array that differentiates it from a linked list, according to the study material?", "options": {"A": "It can store multiple items of the same data type.", "B": "Its elements are stored at contiguous memory locations.", "C": "It allows for common operations like searching and sorting.", "D": "Its first element is always indexed by a subscript of 0."}, "correct": "B"}, {"question": "A concert ticketing system uses a data structure to manage customer requests. When customers join the line, they are served in the order they arrived, meaning the first customer in line is the first to get a ticket.
