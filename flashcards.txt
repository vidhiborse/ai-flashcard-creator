CARD 1
Q: Differentiate between linear and non-linear data structures, providing two examples for each.
A: Linear data structures arrange data elements sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements. Examples: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List. Non-linear data structures do not place data elements sequentially or linearly, meaning all elements cannot be traversed in a single run. Examples: Tree, Graph.
--------------------------------------------------

CARD 2
Q: Explain the key difference between static and dynamic data structures, giving an example for each.
A: Static data structures have a fixed memory size, making it easier to access elements. An example is an array. Dynamic data structures do not have a fixed size; their size can be randomly updated during runtime, which can be efficient concerning memory (space) complexity. Examples include a queue and a stack.
--------------------------------------------------

CARD 3
Q: Describe an array, including its memory allocation, indexing, and one real-life application mentioned in the study material.
A: An array is a linear data structure and a collection of items of the same type stored at contiguous memory locations. The first element of an array is indexed by a subscript of 0. A real-life application of an array is storing data for mathematical computations or image processing.
--------------------------------------------------

CARD 4
Q: Compare Stack and Queue data structures by explaining the particular order (principle) in which operations are performed for each.
A: A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, meaning the last element entered is the first one retrieved. A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle, meaning the data item stored first will be accessed first.
--------------------------------------------------

CARD 5
Q: Define Time Complexity and explain what factors it *does not* directly measure when evaluating an algorithm's performance.
A: Time Complexity is a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm, based on the length of the input or the size of the processed data. It measures how many times it takes to run a given algorithm. It does not measure the actual execution time, as factors like programming language, operating system, and processing power are also considered and affect actual runtime.
